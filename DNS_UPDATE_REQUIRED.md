# 🚨 DNS UPDATE REQUIRED - Forms Are Working!

## ✅ Good News: Your Forms Are Working!

The server is successfully running on DigitalOcean at:
- **Working URL:** https://kfar-landing-page-ijdce.ondigitalocean.app
- **Health Check:** ✅ Configured
- **SendGrid:** ✅ Working
- **Form Submissions:** ✅ Saving successfully

## ❌ Issue: Domain Still Points to GitHub

Your domain `kfarmarket.com` is pointing to GitHub Pages (which can't run forms).

### Current DNS (Wrong):
```
kfarmarket.com → 185.199.108.153 (GitHub Pages)
```

### Needed DNS (Correct):
```
kfarmarket.com → kfar-landing-page-ijdce.ondigitalocean.app
```

## 🔧 How to Fix (2 Options)

### Option 1: Update DNS at Your Domain Registrar

1. **Login to your domain registrar** (where you bought kfarmarket.com)
2. **Find DNS settings**
3. **Delete all A records** pointing to GitHub (185.199.x.x)
4. **Add CNAME record:**
   - Name: `@` or blank
   - Value: `kfar-landing-page-ijdce.ondigitalocean.app`

### Option 2: Use DigitalOcean DNS (Recommended)

1. **Change nameservers** at your domain registrar to:
   - ns1.digitalocean.com
   - ns2.digitalocean.com
   - ns3.digitalocean.com

2. **In DigitalOcean**, the domain will automatically connect to your app
