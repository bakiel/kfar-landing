# Urgent Fixes Needed - KFAR Shop

## 1. Email Confirmation Issue

### Possible Causes:
- SendGrid domain authentication not complete
- FROM_EMAIL using unverified domain
- Email going to spam

### Quick Debug Steps:
1. Check SendGrid dashboard for email activity
2. Verify domain authentication status
3. Check spam folders

### Temporary Solution:
Add email fallback notification in the success message:
```javascript
// In the form submission response
showNotification('success', `Welcome! If you don't receive an email within 5 minutes, please check your spam folder or contact us at info@kfarmarket.com`);
```

## 2. Tablet Responsiveness Fix

Add tablet-specific breakpoints to the mobile menu:

```css
/* Tablet breakpoints */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  .mobile-menu {
    /* Keep mobile menu for tablets */
  }
  
  .desktop-menu {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

## 3. Payment Methods Text Update

Change: "Israeli payment methods" 
To: "Multiple payment methods"
