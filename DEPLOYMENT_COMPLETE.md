# ✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - KFAR Coming Soon

## 🎉 GitHub Push Successful!

Your code is now live at: https://github.com/bakiel/kfar-landing

## 📋 Final Steps for DigitalOcean

### 1. Update Your Existing App

Since you already have an app at:
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/58ecdba3-e1b6-4a3a-8d48-5268572c5550

You need to:

1. **Go to App Settings** → Source
2. **Click "Edit"** 
3. **Ensure it's connected to** `bakiel/kfar-landing` repository
4. **Branch:** main
5. **Auto-deploy:** Enabled

### 2. Update App Spec

In the App Settings → App Spec:

1. Click "Edit"
2. Replace the entire spec with the contents of `app.yaml`
3. Click "Save"

### 3. Add Environment Variables

In the App Settings → Environment Variables:

Add these SECRET variables:
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` = (copy from your .env file)
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` = (copy from your .env file)

These are already in the app.yaml but need the actual values.

### 4. Trigger Deployment

Click "Deploy" to trigger a new deployment with the updated code.

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### 1. Check Health
```bash
curl https://kfarmarket.com/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "sendgrid": "configured",
  "dataDir": "/workspace/form-data"
}
```

### 2. Test Form Submission
Visit https://kfarmarket.com and submit a test form.

### 3. Check Admin Data
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer kfar-admin-secure-2025" \
  https://kfarmarket.com/api/admin/submissions
```
