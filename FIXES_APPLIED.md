# âœ… Fixes Applied Successfully

## 1. Marketplace â†’ Shop

**Changed:**
- All instances of "Marketplace" replaced with "Shop"
- All instances of "marketplace" replaced with "shop"
- Updated in both `index.html` and `server.js`
- Email subjects now say "KFAR Shop" instead of "KFAR Marketplace"

**Result:** The entire site now uses "Shop" terminology

## 2. Mobile Menu Fix

**Problem:** Mobile menu was overlapping with other elements

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Increased z-index** of mobile menu to 9999 (highest priority)
2. **Added styles** to prevent body scroll when menu is open
3. **Fixed positioning** to ensure full screen coverage
4. **Enhanced touch targets** for better mobile experience

**Technical Changes:**
```css
#mobileMenu {
    z-index: 9999 !important;
}
body.menu-open {
    overflow: hidden;
    position: fixed;
    width: 100%;
}
```
