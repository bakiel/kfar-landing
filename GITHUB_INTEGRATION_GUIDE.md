# GitHub Integration Setup for Claude

## Benefits of GitHub Integration

1. **Direct Code Editing** - I can edit files directly in the repository
2. **Automatic Commits** - Changes are tracked with proper commit messages
3. **Pull Requests** - I can create PRs for review before merging
4. **Issue Tracking** - I can create and manage issues
5. **Better Collaboration** - You can review my changes before they go live

## Quick Setup Steps

### Option 1: GitHub App (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/apps/claude-ai
2. Click "Install" 
3. Select your repository: `bakiel/kfar-landing`
4. Grant permissions
5. Share the installation link with me

### Option 2: Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes:
   - `repo` (full control)
   - `workflow` (if using GitHub Actions)
4. Copy the token
5. Share it with me securely

## What I Can Do With GitHub Integration

- **Fix bugs faster** - Direct commits without copy/paste
- **Create branches** - Test changes safely
- **Manage PRs** - Review changes before merging
- **Update multiple files** - Batch changes efficiently
- **Run GitHub Actions** - Automated testing/deployment

## For Your Current Issue (Scrolling)

With GitHub integration, I could:
1. Create a branch: `fix/mobile-menu-scrolling`
2. Fix the scrolling issue directly
3. Test the changes
4. Create a PR for your review
5. Auto-deploy when merged

## Security Note

- GitHub integration is secure
- I only access repositories you explicitly grant
- All changes are tracked in Git history
- You maintain full control

Would you like to set this up? It would make fixing issues like the mobile menu scrolling much faster!
