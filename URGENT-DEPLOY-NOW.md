# URGENT: Push to GitHub

The client is seeing the wrong file. To fix this immediately:

## Quick Deploy (1 minute):

1. Open Terminal
2. Run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/mac/Downloads/kfar-final/deploy-coming-soon-1
./push-to-github.sh
```

This will force push the correct files with SendGrid integration to your repository.

## What's Being Deployed:
- ✅ index.html (with SendGrid form submission)
- ✅ server.js (SendGrid API backend)
- ✅ All image assets
- ✅ Package.json with dependencies

## Important Notes:
- The forms use SendGrid API (configured in server.js)
- Make sure SendGrid API key is set in your environment
- The repository will be updated immediately

## After Push:
1. Check https://github.com/bakiel/kfar-landing
2. If using GitHub Pages, it may take 1-2 minutes to update
3. Clear browser cache if needed

## Need Help?
If the push fails, manually copy all files from this folder to your local git repository and push.
